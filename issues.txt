Alex the Allegator 4 PE Issues
------------------------------

[X]Fix up all timed loops with proper Allegro Legacy sleep logic.

[X]Add build scripts for building and packaging.

[X]Load and save files from/to the correct folders instead of next to the
   executable.

[X]Add proper 'sharp bilinear' scale to get the framebuffer onto the screen. We
   should create a framebuffer that's a multiple of the internal framebuffer
   size that fits within the 'ALLEGRO_DISPLAY' and scale that up using bilinear
   filtering to fill the display.

   [X]We should have an 'ALLEGRO_BITMAP' that matches the dimensions of
      'swap_screen'. We'll copy 'swap_screen' here and make a hardware
      accelerated draw of that to the larger framebuffer.
   
   [X]We need a second 'ALLEGRO_BITMAP' that has bilinear filtering enabled.
      We'll scale the 'swap_screen' clone onto this one and finally scale it
      onto the display.

   [X]Default to full screen mode.

   [X]Make windowed mode create the largest display that's an integer scale of
      the internal resolution that fits within the desktop.

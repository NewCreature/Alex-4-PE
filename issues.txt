Alex the Allegator 4 PE Issues
------------------------------

[ ]Fix up all timed loops with proper Allegro Legacy sleep logic.

[ ]Add build scripts for building and packaging.

   [ ]Consider creating a porting toolkit with a similar structure to T3F. This
      toolkit would let you place the game's data files in the 'bin' folder and
      its source files in 'src' and just list the files we need to compile in a
      definitions file that contains information about the project.

[X]Load and save files from/to the correct folders instead of next to the
   executable.

[X]Add proper 'sharp bilinear' scale to get the framebuffer onto the screen. We
   should create a framebuffer that's a multiple of the internal framebuffer
   size that fits within the 'ALLEGRO_DISPLAY' and scale that up using bilinear
   filtering to fill the display.

   [X]We should have an 'ALLEGRO_BITMAP' that matches the dimensions of
      'swap_screen'. We'll copy 'swap_screen' here and make a hardware
      accelerated draw of that to the larger framebuffer.
   
   [X]We need a second 'ALLEGRO_BITMAP' that has bilinear filtering enabled.
      We'll scale the 'swap_screen' clone onto this one and finally scale it
      onto the display.

   [X]Default to full screen mode.

   [X]Make windowed mode create the largest display that's an integer scale of
      the internal resolution that fits within the desktop.
